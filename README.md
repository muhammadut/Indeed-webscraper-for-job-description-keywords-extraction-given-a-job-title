# Indeed-webscraper-for-job-description-keywords-extraction-given-a-job-title
This script generates a corpus for NLP projects.
The main idea is to get industry specific keywords for a given a job title which i inputted by the user. 

It will scrape job descriptions and store it in a dataframe. Later in the 2nd phase of this project I will use the corpus to generate top keywords common amongst different job posting so student or applicants can polish their resumes & learn critical skills that the industry demands!
