    "# Webscraping job descriptions from Indeed for keyword extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Know the ATS bots: \n",
    "\n",
    "ATS stands for applicant tracking system. In short, an ATS is a piece of software used by employers to scan and rank the online job applications they receive for their open positions. These bots were initially created with large organizations in mind, which needed help sifting through the thousands of incoming applications they received on a weekly basis. An estimated 95% of Fortune 500 companies currently use an ATS to manage their applicant tracking process. Today, this software has become popular with employers and recruiting firms of all shapes and sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of ATSs as the gatekeepers to your dream job. You’ve got to get past them first in order to succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keywords matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Using action verbs like “outperformed,” “solved,” “led,” and “delivered,” are essential when crafting a resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "But keywords that are specific to a job description for example skills for a data scientist will probably involve: Python, R, SQL, machine learning, hadoop etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other skills companies want to see like communication, leadership. Although, these are generic keywords but I would like to get industry specific keywords generated. Or atleast I hope so \n",
    "\n",
    "These compelling action verbs powerfully show off what you did in each of your roles. However, when it comes to the bots, you’ve got to kick things up a notch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important element — beyond formatting your resume so it can be accurately ‘read’ and parsed by the ATS — is keyword optimization. This is how the applicant tracking system determines if you possess the necessary qualifications to be considered for the position. In addition to listing out a specific term, be sure to also include any common abbreviations to cover your bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "However,  it is warned keyword stuffing or packing your resume and cover letter with buzzwords is not something you wanna do. \n",
    "\n",
    "__If the ATS can’t sift through the B.S., I guarantee the recruiter or hiring manager will — and then promptly dismiss your application. Instead use keywords sparingly and intelligently.__\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure your resume is compatible with ATS system, it is advised to incorporate the best keywords throughout your resume 2-3 times, with at least one of those references falling within your Work Experience or Education section. It’s one thing to state that “SEO (search engine optimization)” is among your core competencies, but it’s another thing entirely to show where in your employment history you leveraged that knowledge to add value to an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Movtivation behind this notebook: \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, I wanted to learn & practise web-scraping and NLP techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to help me & my friends who are graduating this year help polish their resume with industry specific keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high level idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user goes on indeed.com and searches up the job title they wants to find keywords for. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: the user will input \"data science intern\" on the indeed home page and click search \n",
    "\n",
    "2. They will then copy the first page link into the variable __initial_searchpage_url__\n",
    "\n",
    "3. They will then run the script as shown below. Basically it will go into each profile link and copy all the text from the job postings. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. It will finally return a list of all lines found in all the jobs you scraped\n",
    "\n"

    "I tried a of lot scripts, my first try was to use seleneium but that didnt work because I was trying to find elements by x_path, every job has its unique x_path except for the first 3 and the last 2. Their x_paths are fixed. So I had to do a lot of stack overflow before I kinda learned how to use beautifulsoup, urllib, & requests packages\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a good starting point for webscraping & keyword selection. Naturally, I have seen pros build more complex, robust, faster crawlers for scraping. But I am no programming genius. I get by reading stackoverflow and documentation. \n",
